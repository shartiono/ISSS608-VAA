# **Prototyping Modules for Visual Analytics Shiny Application**

> *"Prototyping first may help keep you from investing far too much time for marginal gains."*\

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Project Overview

This prototype continues from [Take-home Exercise 2](https://isss608-shar.netlify.app/take-home_ex/take-home_ex_2/take-home_ex_2), based on **Mini-Challenge 2 (MC2)** from the VAST Challenge 2025, which investigates claims of bias within the fictional government committee **COOTEFOO**, amid tensions between economic development and cultural preservation in Oceanus.

Oceanus faces competing visions from:

-   **Fishing is Living and Heritage (FILAH)** – preserving traditional fishing zones.
-   **Tourism Raises OceanUs Together (TROUT)** – promoting tourism-led growth.

Both groups have accused **COOTEFOO** of favoring the other. To investigate, we analyze:

-   🟦 **FILAH.json** – records submitted by the pro-fishing group
-   🟨 **TROUT.json** – records from the pro-tourism group
-   🟩 **journalist.json** – independent reports to provide a neutral perspective
-   🗺️ **oceanus_map.geojson** – official zoning map of Oceanus
-   🛣️ **road_map.json** – road network infrastructure

📝 *All datasets were provided through the official VAST Challenge MC2 instruction page and included in the exercise folder (`data/`).*

We aim to build a **modular Shiny app prototype** that allows stakeholders to: 1. View which COOTEFOO members are most frequently discussed 2. Analyze the topics and sentiment associated with each 3. Compare bias across datasets 4. Explore geographic movement patterns

This report outlines our **Quarto-based storyboard prototype**, which will be integrated into a future Shiny app.

## 2. Required R Packages

The following packages are used to support data wrangling, spatial analysis, network exploration, and interactive prototyping:

-   **`tidyverse`**: Core data science suite (`dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `tidyr`, etc.)
-   **`jsonlite`**: Read/write structured JSON data
-   **`sf`**: Handle and visualize spatial vector data (simple features)
-   **`lubridate`**: Manage and format date-time objects
-   **`DT`**: Render interactive tables for HTML display
-   **`shiny`**: Build interactive web applications
-   **`visNetwork`**: Generate interactive network visualizations
-   **`igraph`**: Perform network analysis (e.g., centrality, clusters)
-   **`stringr`**: Handle and manipulate string data

## 3. Data Import

The following datasets are used in this prototype. These were provided as part of the VAST Challenge 2025 Mini-Challenge 2.

-   `FILAH.json`: Records provided by the fishing advocacy group
-   `TROUT.json`: Records from the tourism advocacy group
-   `journalist.json`: Independent data contributed by journalists
-   `oceanus_map.geojson`: Oceanus spatial zoning map
-   `road_map.json`: Road network of Oceanus

<details>

<summary>📥 Load JSON and GeoJSON Files</summary>

```{r}
# Load JSON-based knowledge graphs
filah <- jsonlite::fromJSON("data/FILAH.json")
trout <- jsonlite::fromJSON("data/TROUT.json")
journalist <- jsonlite::fromJSON("data/journalist.json")

# Load spatial files
oceanus_map <- sf::st_read("data/oceanus_map.geojson")
road_map <- jsonlite::fromJSON("data/road_map.json", simplifyDataFrame = TRUE)

```
