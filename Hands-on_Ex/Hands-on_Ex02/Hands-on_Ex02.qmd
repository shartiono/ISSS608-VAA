# Beyond ggplot2 Fundamentals

# 2.1 Getting started

In addition to tidyverse, four R packages will be used in this exercise, namely:

-   ggrepel

-   ggthemes

-   hrbrthemes

-   patchwork

Code chunk below will be used to check if these packages have been installed and also will load them onto the R environment.


```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggrepel, patchwork, 
               ggthemes, hrbrthemes,
               tidyverse) 
```
